// Class
// Classes are one of the features introduced in the ES6 version of JavaScript.
// A class is a blueprint for the object. You can create an object from the class.

// Class is a programmer-defined data type, which includes local methods and 
// local variables.
// Class is a collection of objects. Object has properties and behavior.
// First we have to define a class, where class name should be same as 
// filename.
// When class is created, we can create any number of objects in that class. The 
// object is created with the help of the new keyword.

// How to create classes?
// In order to create a class, we group the code that handles a certain topic into 
// one place.
// 1. We declare the class with the class keyword.
// 2. We write the name of the class and capitalize the first letter.
// Example : Car
// 3. If the class name contains more than one word, we capitalize 
// each word. This is known as upper camel case
// Example : Car_Class
// 4. We circle the class body within curly braces. Inside the curly 
// braces, we put our code. 
// Class Car {}

// Class syntax
